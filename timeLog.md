#### Week 01
5 hours

#### Week 02
4 Hours

#### Week 03 (now with proper reflection statements)
4 Hours worked.

This past week was a bit hard for me to get going due to some personal issues blocking me.
That said, I have been able to catch up and take a step back to really think about what
I would like my project to look like, both as the MVP and as the future final product.
I feel more comfortable with log4j and unit testing and feel that I will be able to
incorporate these into the project effectively.

#### Week 04
5 Hours worked

This week went well overall. I felt comfortable working with Hibernate, and was able
to make some connections between Hibernate and another ORM I was familiar with. Spent
my time working through the exercise and activity, and have not made much progress in
the indie project as of yet.

#### Week 05
6 Hours worked

The week went well. Took longer than intended to finish the exercise due to having moved, but overall I
feel that I understand the concepts and can implement them into the indie project.

#### Week 06

3 hours worked

This week was good, despite some issues I ran in to when trying to get the database set up
in AWS. Overall I feel comfortable with the concepts, just need to keep practicing and
implementing them in the indie project.
