#### Week 03 (now with proper reflection statements)
4 Hours worked.

This past week was a bit hard for me to get going due to some personal issues blocking me.
That said, I have been able to catch up and take a step back to really think about what
I would like my project to look like, both as the MVP and as the future final product.
I feel more comfortable with log4j and unit testing and feel that I will be able to
incorporate these into the project effectively.

#### Week 04
5 Hours worked

This week went well overall. I felt comfortable working with Hibernate, and was able
to make some connections between Hibernate and another ORM I was familiar with. Spent
my time working through the exercise and activity, and have not made much progress in
the indie project as of yet.
