#### Problem Statement
There are no comprehensive tools for damage calculation/battle simulation for the
game Pokemon Unite.

#### Solution Statement
A program designed to use character stats to give estimated damage calculations
that can be used to predict the outcomes of fights.

#### User Story 1
A player new to the game has found a lot of enjoyment in playing, and is looking to further
develop their skills in order to play in the more competitive modes. They are looking to
find a character "main", but want to assess the individual stats first to make sure
they are putting their time and hard work in to a decent character. They look online to find
a resource that allows them to get rough damage estimates so they have a better idea of
what sort of outcomes they could expect in-game. The ability to make an account on the site to
save their calculations is desirable, as it will give them the resources to refer back to as
they play.

#### User Story 2
A seasoned player is looking to climb back up to a Master ranking in the new season. They have
a list of characters that they enjoy playing, but have lost track of stat values with the
recent updates. What they are looking for is a dynamically updated site where they can
view these stat values and perform mock damage calculations, even when updates are made to
the game and stat values change. An account with the ability to create/setup their main
characters (items, moves, etc) is important, as is the ability to save these characters
and update/delete them as necessary.

#### User Story 3 (Specifically for the MVP)
A casual player is looking to be more effective while playing the game with their friends.
They think a good start would be to have some general knowledge of stat values of the 
different characters. The site they are looking for would deliver, at minimum, the stat values
in a comprehensive table that they are able to easily read as a reference point. Similar to the
seasoned player, the ability to create, save, and delete characters is important so
that they are able to keep track of their characters/battles.
