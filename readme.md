#### Problem Statement
There are no comprehensive tools for damage calculation/battle simulation for the
game Pokemon Unite.

#### Solution Statement
A program designed to use character stats to give estimated damage calculations
that can be used to predict the outcomes of fights.

#### User Story 1
A player new to the game has found a lot of enjoyment in playing, and is looking to further
develop their skills in order to play in the more competitive modes. They are looking to
find a character "main", but want to assess the individual stats first to make sure
they are putting their time and hard work in to a decent character. They look online to find
a resource that allows them to get rough damage estimates so they have a better idea of
what sort of outcomes they could expect in-game.

#### User Story 2
A seasoned player is looking to climb back up to a Master ranking in the new season. They have
a list of characters that they enjoy playing, but have lost track of stat values with the
recent updates. What they are looking for is a dynamically updated site where they can
view these stat values and perform mock damage calculations, even when updates are made to
the game and stat values change.
