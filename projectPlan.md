#### Weeks 1 - 4
These weeks were to really think about what I wanted to do for my project,
and what I would like the eventual outcome to be. I also took time to set up
the repo and to start putting together the files I will need for the project.

#### Weeks 5 - 7
For this time period I would like to be able to do more than what is listed for the
2nd checkpoint. I will be sure to have my database set up to the standards listed,
but would also like to possibly have a better idea of the classes I will need to 
include for the project. I would also like to possibly get some of the JSP files started.
They would of course have no real data yet, but I think that setting them up with bootstrap
and a general color scheme would be a good way to start mapping out what I want it to
look like. This would be a good time period to start getting AWS set up so that
I can start pushing files to work toward the MVP.

#### Weeks 6 - 9
In addition to the standards for the week 9 checkpoint, I want to have all of my JSP files mostly
set up by this time, and to have the application really starting to come together. At least
one of them will be set up with the database, though I hope to have more completed. At the very
least I will have the design of all of the pages complete with bootstrap and a semi-polished look.
At this point I think that having the JSP files complete would give me the extra time later on
to fully focus on the inner workings of the application.

#### Weeks 10 - 14
During this time period I am going to make sure all of the JSP files are fully functional.
I will be working heavily on the back end and getting the project put together. I would like
to have almost everything complete within this timeframe in terms of design and code, so that
the remaining weeks can be spent testing and cleaning up the files. By this point I hope
to have AWS completely set up and have my pushes being added to it regularly.

#### Weeks 14 - Finish
At this point I will have the majority of the project done, and will be spending the 
remainder of my time focussing on polishing up the code and fixing any bugs that
have arisen. Ideally, I would have all of this out of the way in Week 14, and could use the
remaining time having others test out the application in case there are some functional issues
that I have overlooked.

#### All Weeks
Each week that we learn a new program/functionality I would like to do some work
incorporating that into the project in addition to the other work I will be doing (e.g Hibernate).
